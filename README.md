### Find out which movies actors have starred in together

As a lover of movie trivia, sometimes I watch movies and wonder which other movies two or more actors have been in together. For instance, while watching `The Irishman`, I knew Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino had starred in several movies together (The Godfather, Heat, etc.), but with Joe Pesci in the movie I wonder how many movies they have all been together in.

While there are some solutions online to find which movies two actors have been in together, I couldn't find an online solution that could handle searching for more than two actors.

So, this is my project to help do just that.

Enjoy!
